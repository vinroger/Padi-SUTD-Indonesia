### Website for PADI (Perhimpunan Mahasiswa SUTD Indonesia)

https://padisutd.xyz

A prototype website built for SUTD Indonesian Cultural Club, "Perhimpunan Mahasiswa Indonesia SUTD" (PADI), to promote events and provide information for the organization. Used Tailwind CSS as the front-end framework.

For the "Contact Us" part, I used Next.js API call and nodemailer module to send an email to private email. 
The viewer of the website does not need to write email by themselves. Everything is automated.
